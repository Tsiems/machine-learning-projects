    "The NFL (National Football League) has 32 teams split into two conferences, the AFC and NFC. Each of the 32 teams plays 16 games during the regular season (non-playoff season) every year. Due to the considerable viewership of American football, as well as the pervasiveness of fantasy football, considerable data about the game is collected. During the 2015-2016 season, information about every play from each game that occurred was logged. All of that data was consolidated into a single data set which is analyzed throughout this report.\n",

    "### The Classification Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to classify plays based on play type using information about the state of the game prior to the start of the play. This is expected to be an exceptionally difficult classification task, due to the amount of noise in the dataset (specifically, the decision to run vs pass the ball is often a seemingly random one). A successful classifier would have huge value to defensive coordinators, who could call plays based on the expected offensive playcall. Because it may be very difficult to identify what play will be called, it is relevant to provide a probability of a given playcall in a situation. For example, it would be useful to provide the probability of a 4th down conversion attempt, even if the overall prediction is that a punt occurs. "

For our use, we assume that it is okay to use data in the “future” to predict data “now” because it can represent data from a previous football season. For example, if we use the first 90% of data for training and the remaining 10% of data for testing, that would simulate using most of the current season's data to predict plays towards the end of this season. If we use the first 50% and last 40% of data for training and the remaining 10% for testing, this would simulate using 40% of the previous season's data and the first 50% of this season's data to predict plays happening around the middle of the current season. \n",
