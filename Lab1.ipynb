    "The NFL (National Football League) has 32 teams split into two conferences, the AFC and NFC. Each of the 32 teams plays 16 games during the regular season (non-playoff season) every year. Due to the considerable viewership of American football, as well as the pervasiveness of fantasy football, considerable data about the game is collected. During the 2015-2016 season, information about every play from each game that occurred was logged. All of that data was consolidated into a single data set which is analyzed throughout this report."

The first goal, motivated by the prevalance of fantasy football, is to identify players who perform exceptionally well, and specifically to identify in what situations a player excels. The second goal, motivated by the need for coaching insights, is to produce situationally-aware metrics for the potential success of a play. For example: given a field location, score differential, team, and time, identify what type of play is most likely to be successful. "

    "Two forms of player performance analysis are relevant for fantasy football and general player performance evaluation. The first is a novel analysis, wherein all players of a certain position are ranked based on their performance at that position. This analysis can provide insight into identifying which players are most valueable for a fantasy team. The second is player-to-player comparison. Fantasy players are often faced with a decision of which player to play on their fantasy team in any given week. They must choose between players based on their individual player performances, as well as their matchups for the week. Consider a situation where player A is individually superior to player B, but player B is facing a team whose defense is very weak, while player A is facing a team whose defense is strong. Which player is expected to outperform the other? This question can be answered by analyzing the performance of each individual player against their respective opponents."

    "Offensive play-calling is a very difficult task, and is often a cause of error for teams and coaches. Providing a data-informed situational understanding of the probable outcomes of certain types of plays could help inform coaches' play-calling. Analyzing the statistical outcomes of play-calls can be done on  a league-wide, per-team, or per-matchup basis. As the analysis becomes more specific (narrowing down to a specific team, or a specific matchup of two teams), the relevance of the analysis increases, but so does the margin of error."

    "Any meaningful player performance analysis must include a novel look at season-long player performance. For a running back, for example, total carries, yards, and touchdowns must be calculated. However, this novel analysis is simply a baseline. In order for a player performance analysis to be considered effective or meaningful, specific trends must be identified for that player which do not appear during routine stat summaries. For example, for a running back, a meaningful and effective analysis may conclude that the player in question performs significantly better when playing against teams whose defenses are very strong against passing plays, or that he performs significantly better when playing away, as opposed to at home."
